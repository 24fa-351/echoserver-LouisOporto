# Requirements
Create a server that communicates with incoming clients that want to echo and communicate

- The server needs to broadcast all incoming messages to the address/port
- Clients receive message from other connections
- Clients can send messages to the server
- Multiple users can join the server
- Clients can disconnect and close their connection with the server (server handles disconnection)
- Server can optionally have a selected port to listen to (default 25565 idk)
